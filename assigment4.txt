Title :- Youtube Video Downloader

Introduction:

This is a GUI based application which is basically 
used to download the youtube video by using its link 
address. This application has a listbox which shows the 
different streams in which we want to download like 
audio or video with various other options.
This application has a progress bar label 
which will show the progress of its download. 

Requirement:

1. This application is requires one of the library of 
   python which is Tkinter.
2. It also requires Pytube library of python.

Summary & Implementation:

This is GUI application to download videos of youtube 
which is made by Tkinter library of python. It takes 
the input from the user which is basically the link 
address of the video then the pytube library recognises
the link and in listbox it display the different streams
in which video or audio can be downloaded. After selecting
one of the streams it starts downloading. The downloading
process shows the progress level of the video its total size,
remaing size to download and speed of downloading. After 
downloading a message will be displayed on the screen.

Problems:

The problem which i faced during its implementation 
was when progress level starts the or activities like 
displaying its remaining size gets stop. so, i overcome
this challenge by using threading module in this application
which solves this problem. Threading module generally
helps to show all the activities running in the same program
without hampering other.
